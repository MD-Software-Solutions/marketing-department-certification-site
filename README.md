Yo, yea idk. See if you can fix the responsiveness. It work jsut fine when you inspect and adjust using the responsiveness slider, but when you start picking out individual devices, it kinda just breaks.


But if you cant fix, just start ading pages to the standard or whatever. Then just dm me about and I will just brute force the fix or just dont show it to mr johnson and wait to find a solution later
