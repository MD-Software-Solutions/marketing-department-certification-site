                                My name is Christian Emenecker. I am a Hospitality Management major at the University of South Carolina. I graduated from Johns Creek in 2022 and spent three years in the marketing program at JCHS. My most memorable experience in the marketing program was the Restaurant Project. Conceptualizing, planning, and executing this fully operational restaurant concept was a rewarding and inspiring experience. This experience exposed me to key aspects of the industry, from menu costing to performing various roles in the kitchen. These skills have transitioned into my collegiate and professional careers and provided a strong foundation for my career.

                                Marketing was my absolute favorite high school class. Mr. Johnson is such an amazing teacher and mentor. He uses real world examples to make learning about marketing fun and engaging. I also gained practical skills like resume writing, job interviewing and working with people. My favorite memory was coming up with a restaurant idea and being able to bring it to life so I could see what it was like to run a real food truck business. I took 3 years of marketing and I loved it so much that I’ve decided to major in it. I’m so thankful for Mr. Johnson and Johns Creek for offering a program that I could have these opportunities.

                                Hi, my name is Christopher Taylor and I am currently a junior at the University of Dayton majoring in Marketing. When I entered Johns Creek HS, I took Marketing my freshman year on a whim.  Little did I know how impactful that class would be.  Throughout my 4 years at JCHS, I took all 6 Marketing classes available and this is how I knew what I wanted my college major to be.  These classes introduced me to the fundamentals of marketing and how it shaped business and consumer decisions. One of the most impactful classes/projects was working on our Restaurant In Real Life project in which we created a restaurant from scratch -  - - developing the name, menu, and branding- and brought it to life in the classroom. We transformed the classroom into a space where we could prepare our food and serve it to other students and faculty around the school. It was a hands on experience that taught me teamwork, creativity, marketing, and the realities of running a business. 

                                I’m more than grateful for the teachers and opportunities that have inspired me to pursue marketing as a career, and I look forward to applying these skills as I continue to grow both academically and professionally.

                                Hi! My name is Caroline Baer, and I am currently a sophomore at Auburn University. I graduated from Johns Creek High School in 2023, where I had the privilege of taking marketing with Mr. Johnson for all four years. Mr. Johnson is a very impactful teacher, and his curriculum left a very lasting impression on me. I am now pursuing a minor in marketing at Auburn, a decision I made fully because of his guidance and inspiration. My time in his classes was filled with meaningful experiences, and I have many great memories during those years. My favorite memory was undoubtedly the restaurant project. It was a very hands-on experience that allowed us to be creative and bring our own restaurant ideas to life. It was the most engaging project I worked on throughout all my time and classes in high school. We did many projects like this throughout his classes. Mr. Johnson is a teacher that makes an effort with his students to connect on a personal level and that’s what makes his classes so special. During my senior year, I had the opportunity to take his digital marketing class, which quickly became my favorite. The course stood out to me because of its relevance and modernness. Both of these attributes are something Mr. Johnson strives to include in all his classes. He is constantly coming up with new ideas and projects to keep his classes engaging. I would immediately recommend Mr. Johnson's classes to anyone with even a little interest in marketing.  I am incredibly grateful for the four years I spent learning from him!

                                Hi everyone! After graduating from JCHS in 2018, I attended Georgia College in Milledgeville and earned my degree in Elementary Education. I currently teach Kindergarten in a Fulton County school and love it. Although I always knew I wanted to be a teacher, I joined DECA and took marketing classes to gain experiences outside of my future career field. Communication skills and the ability to lead are valuable in any career, and the marketing program is a great way to develop these qualities early on. Go gladiators!

                                Sabrina graduated from Johns Creek in 2019 after participating in the marketing pathway
                                for 3 years. She attended the University of Georgia, where she triple majored in Fashion
                                Merchandising, Consumer Economics, and Housing Management and Policy. Sabrina
                                graduated Summa Cum Laude at UGA and was awarded with the Presidential Award of
                                Excellence at the end of her college career, which is awarded to individuals who represent the
                                top 1% of undergraduates at UGA who excel in academics, service, and leadership. Sabrina
                                currently works as a Merchandising Planner Analyst at the Home Depot, where she supports
                                the Outdoor Garden merchandising team.
                                Sabrina credits the Hospitality Marketing program at Johns Creek for helping her
                                navigate all of the pieces of the job application process. From building a résumé, to nailing the
                                final job interview, the marketing program helped her gain an understanding of what employers
                                are looking for when hiring. Mr. Johnson’s class gave her the opportunity to practice job
                                interviews, which in turn helped her build confidence for future interviews. The various
                                presentations and projects also built her confidence for public speaking. Additionally, the
                                marketing program at Johns Creek taught her all of the steps that are involved in running a
                                business, which she found useful throughout all of her jobs in retail. Sabrina credits the
                                Hospitality Marketing program for being the most helpful aspect of her high school career as it
                                gave her the skills she needed to feel confident and secure throughout the entire job application
                                process after graduation.
                                Some highlights from her time in the Hospitality Marketing program include the field trip
                                to the Avalon Hotel, the create-your-own restaurant project, and the mock job interviews in
                                class.                            </p>
